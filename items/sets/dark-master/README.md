# Dark Master

This is an armor that an unknown warrior accidentally found in the Temple of Kalima.

The purpose of the goddess creating it is engraved on the back of the armor: "The final battle is about to begin, lucky ones, you put it on; unlucky ones, you put it on..."

The mysterious spell, apart from confirming that this is a set of armor with terrifying power, seems to indicate some revelation about fate...
