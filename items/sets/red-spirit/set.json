But the witch killed Hargness in order to make this set of armor a unique treasure. Later, Bapost, the elf king, dueled with Beryl, but failed to leave a trace on its armor.\n\nBapost was extremely resentful, and after passing the throne to the elf prince Junidio, he returned to the Fairy Forest.",
