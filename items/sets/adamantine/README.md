# Adamantine set

The Goddess forged it out of a dark metal from the Daedric lairs. The power of darkness is suppressed in this metal, emitting a faint blue light.

"Those who suppress the darkness with the power of darkness and are strong enough to bear the pain of darkness, wake up."

The power of darkness is powerful and even more painful, and only the Holy Teacher can bear the pain of this powerful darkness.

For other professions, wearing this set of armor would mean collapse.
