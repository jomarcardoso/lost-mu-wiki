Familiar goblin friends in the center of Noria Village are transforming into purple
Chaos NPCs and combining items. We will unveil the wing items that have been veiled
in the meantime and the new chaos weapon items that will be introduced.

This patch cames with 3 New Weapons, that were strong at that time, and, of course,
the first three wings.

### New weapons:

- [Chaos Dragon Axe](/item/chaos_dragon_axe)
- [Chaos Lighting Staff](/item/chaos_lighting_staff)
- [Chaos Nature Bow](/item/chaos_nature_bow)

### Three level one wings.

Magic Gladiador can equip DK's, DW's wings:

- [Wings of Satan](/item/wings_of_satan)
- [Wings of Heaven](/item/wings_of_heaven)
- [Wings of Elf](/item/wings_of_elf)

## How to create your first wing

Creating 1st Level Wings requires two stages, and you need to start making a
Chaos Weapon.

### First Stage

In the first stage you will need to mix in the Chaos Machine the following:

- 1 equipment +4 (minimum) + 4 option (minimum)
- 1 [Jewel of Chaos](/item/jewel_of_chaos)
- 1 [Jewel of Bless](/item/jewel_of_bless) (optional - it increases success rate)
- 1 [Jewel of Soul](/item/jewel_of_soul) (optional - it increases success rate)

The Chaos Weapon resulted could be either [Chaos Nature Bow](/item/chaos_nature_bow),
[Chaos Dragon Axe](/item/chaos_dragon_axe) or [Chaos Lighting Staff](/item/chaos_lighting_staff).

### Second Stage

In the second and last stage of creating 1st Level Wings you will need to upgrade
the Chaos Item made to +4 and +4 option, at least, to use it in the second stage,
creating your wings. To mix the wings put the following items in the Chaos Machine:

- 1 Chaos Item +4 (minimum) + 4 option (minimum)
- 1 [Jewel of Chaos](/item/jewel_of_chaos)
- 10.000 ~ 1.000.000 Zen
- 1 [Jewel of Bless](/item/jewel_of_bless) (optional - it increases success rate)
- 1 [Jewel of Soul](/item/jewel_of_soul) (optional - it increases success rate)
- 1 Equipped Item +4 (minimum) + 4 Option (minimum) (optional - it increases success rate)

Your combination will result in one of the three 1st Level Wings:
[Wings of Satan](/item/wings_of_satan), [Wings of Heaven](/item/wings_of_heaven),
[Wings of Elf](/item/wings_of_elf)
