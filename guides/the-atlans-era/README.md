# The Atlans's Era <small>(0.64)</small>

Behind Noria , a beautiful fairy forest, there was a gloomy deep sea called [Atlans](/map/atlans) like Janus... Dark deep sea Atlans! You must be level 60 or higher to enter Atlans, and you have to swim underwater except for the safe zone...

## Atlans story

An underwater world ruled by the renegade [Hydra of Kundun](/map/atlans#hydra). It was a place where the ancient Atlans lived and was forgotten in the human world, but it became known with the [Resurrection of Kundun](/guide/kundun). Atlans is a place that can only be entered through the Secret Spring of the fairy village [Noria](/map/noria).

Kundun, noticing that one of the split sealing stones is at Atlans, sends [Hydra] to destroy Atlans.

In this chaos, some Atlansians fled to the surface world, and some Atlansians flee to the underground city [Kantur](/map/kanturu_ruins), which was destroyed by Hydra's invasion, and try to rebuild it.

### Atlans features

- Entrance location: Right end of Noria World.
- Level limit: Those who have formed a party of 60 or more.
- How to move: You can walk and run only in the safe zone, and move underwater by swimming.
  You can swim fast if you have +5 or higher gloves.
- There are no merchants in the safe zone like in dungeons.
- There is a stone statue pointing to where the Hydra is (route guidance function).

The [Magic Gladiator](/character/magic_gladiator) until this moment only used [Dark Knight's](/character/dark_knight) and [Dark Wizard's](/character/dark_wizard) sets and then received his first armor first called as [Atlan's set](/item/storm_crow) and after renamed to Storm Crow set. This new set is stronger than [Dragon set](/item/dragon) and its the first set that doesn't have helm, exclusive to Magic Gladiators.

### Other changes in this update

- Critical damage rate +5% additionally applied to lucky items
  (Critical is currently in our game, the hit value is random between the maximum and minimum damage. If the critical damage is 100%, the maximum damage is 100 times. 5% means that if you hit 20 times, one of them is definitely the maximum hit. The conclusion is that the maximum damage or the probability of getting it increases~!)
- Improved attack speed of transformation rings except for skull ring (decreased attack speed of skull ring)
- Fixed with lightning sword spinning skill
- Slash skill attack speed slightly faster Modification
- Up skill mana consumption 8, Downstroke skill mana consumption changed to 12
- Demonic magic mana consumption changed to 90
- The maximum level limit, which was limited to level 255, was modified to level 298
- When moving to a dungeon, both "/dungeon" and "/dungeon" were applied, but only "/dungeon" was applied.
