1. Basic setting: the city only exists in one line in one server.
   In Brave Continent, just move in the direction of coordinates (239 13) (you cannot move commands).
   　 　 ＊ There is no entry restriction for Roland Canyon.
   Roland Canyon is only a combat area during siege warfare, and a safe area at other times.
   　 　 ＊ You can attack directly without pressing Ctrl in the combat area (without reducing experience points).

＊ The safety zone is no different from the usual basic zone. Players must abide by the rules, otherwise they will be punished.
The level of the leader of the Zhanmeng must be above 200, and the level of Zhanmeng members must be above 20 to be eligible to apply for siege.

There can be a total of 4 Zhanmeng alliances participating in the battle ( 1 defending and 3 attacking) . The maximum number of Zhanmeng alliances that issue siege battle applications is 3. Alliance members}+Level of the leader of the war alliance/4 " to calculate the participation of the first three alliances of the war alliance. A Zhanmeng alliance can be composed of 5 ordinary Zhanmengs, and a total of 20 Zhanmengs can participate in the siege battle. A war alliance can have up to 80 people, and a war alliance can have up to 1,600 people participating in a siege battle, not counting third-party war alliances, and there will be more if added.

2. Declare war and siege

Before each siege battle, the war alliance that has a hand in Roland Canyon must register for a declaration of war.

The leader of the war alliance applies from the guard NPC at the gate of the city. Click on the guard NPC to see the username of the current city owner and the information of the war alliance he belongs to.

The leader of the war alliance clicks the guard NPC to see the siege information. The siege status information includes the time of declaration of war, selected time, start time of siege, truce time, etc.

Restrictions on declaring war: War alliance can only be declared when the leader level of the war alliance is above level 200 and the alliance members are over 20. When the above conditions are met, press the "declare war" button to take effect. If the conditions are not met, war cannot be declared.

3. Battle process:

When the siege battle begins, a sword will appear above the head of the attacking party, and a shield will appear above the head of the defending party.
　 　 ＊ The logo of the leader of the War League is slightly different from that of ordinary members.
　 　 ＊ Unselected war alliances and individual players will not have such signs and will be considered neutral.
Roland Canyon is the battle area during the siege battle time, and you can attack without pressing Ctrl.
　 　 ＊ Experience points will not be reduced, and there will be no PK penalty.
　 　 ＊Neutral players can press Ctrl to attack.
Once a siege battle starts, you cannot join or leave a war alliance.

The diagram on the left shows the way forward for the attacker.

The bridge marked by the red circle at the bottom is the defender's first line of defense. The first fierce collision between the attacker and the defender will start on the bridge entering the castle.

Below is the "First City Wall", "Second City Wall"And the "third city wall" , every time a defense line of the defender is broken, it is one step closer to victory, but it is bound to encounter fiercer and more tenacious resistance from the defender.

The last red circle marked the location of the "Dragon Pagoda" and the "King's Collection" . If they reached there, they would be only one step away from the final victory.

\*The alliance between the siege party alliance and the city defense alliance is also counted as the attack party and the city defense party.

- You can press the Ctrl key to attack our members.
  *Whether you are attacked by our side or the enemy's attack, you will be damaged, but the degree of damage is different, and the degree of damage will be greater if you are attacked by our side (players, please don't hit your own people! If you want to be a traitor, that's a different story).
  *Only the leader can engrave the name of the alliance on the crown throne.
  *It takes a while to engrave the name. If you die during the engraving or the crown throne under your feet is destroyed, the engraving will fail.
  *If the attacking party successfully engraves the logo of the war alliance on the crown throne, the attacking party and the defending party will alternate.
  \*At the end of the entire war (after 2 hours), the war alliance whose name is engraved on the crown throne is the winner, that is, the city lord!

## Offensive and defensive signs:

Both the attacking party and the defending party will have war alliance signs, javelins, and shields above their heads, and two hostile alliances [including joint alliances] can also attack without pressing the Ctrl key.

The symbol on the head of the attacker is in the shape of a sword, and the symbol on the head of the defender is in the shape of a shield. The leader of the War League has a crown symbol on his head instead of a sword and shield symbol

＊The default background color of the Zhanmeng logo is the defending side - white, the attacking side - red.

## Strong gates

![](public/img/posts/castle-siege/castle-siege-gates.jpg)

The city gate
itself has defensive power and durability (HP), and can only be attacked during the war time. The durability of the weapon will be drastically damaged when attacking (including skills) the gate, so it is best to use the blessing potion or soul potion to destroy it.

*After the city gate is destroyed during the siege battle, it will not return to its original state and remain in the destroyed state.
*The defense and durability of the city gate can be upgraded to the third stage at most, and the defense and vitality will be upgraded accordingly. (but cannot be upgraded and repaired in war).

### Veteran NPC

Function:

1. Repair and strengthen the 4 guardian stone statues of the 6 city gates, and adjust the tax rate.
2. It cannot be repaired, strengthened and adjusted during the siege battle.

### Tax rate adjustment

The city owner can set the corresponding tax when purchasing items from merchant NPCs in the city.

The tax rate can be adjusted by the elder NPC.

The collected taxes can be used for further development of the contract, which can make your castle stronger.

- Adjust Tax Catalog
- Press the Apply button to apply the adjusted tax rate to the game
- The tax collected is displayed at the elder NPC, and only the lord can get it back.

Regarding tax adjustment settings:

- From the end of the 2-hour siege battle to the next siege battle, the tax rate can be adjusted
  . \* The tax adjustment is divided into two types: the tax rate of the Maya synthetic NPC and the tax rate of other NPCs.
- Only the current lord has the right to adjust the tax rate.
- As long as you press the applicable button, the new tax rate will take effect, and all items will increase the corresponding % tax rate according to his price.
- There is no limit to the number of adjustments to the tax rate.
- The collected tax is displayed in the tax adjustment column of the elder NPC, indicating the gold owned by the castle. (no amount limit)

- Only the city lord (war alliance lord) can withdraw taxes.
- A maximum of 50,000,000 gold can be withdrawn at one time
- The cost of repair and maintenance is withdrawn from the item Rand vault. (In the future, there will be continuous demand for gold coins in the operation of the castle.)
- There is no limit to the number of withdrawals of gold coins.

- Supplements to the rules about operating castles in the siege version

The siege warfare experience area has been officially closed. Have you tasted the taste of being a city lord in the experience area? Are you already trying to run a castle.

In the upcoming version of siege warfare, the leader of a single alliance cannot operate the entire castle after becoming the lord of the city. Only when the city lord is the leader of the United Alliance, can he enter the land of magic refining and operate the castle.

If you are already our chief city lord, you only need to let any other alliance join you, then you can operate the castle after updating the siege warfare version.

You must submit a joint application to you from other alliances , not you to the leaders of other alliances, so that you can become the leader of the alliance and operate the castle.

## Guardian Statues

![](public/img/posts/castle-siege/guardian-statue.jpg)

When all 4 statues inside the castle have been destroyed, the shield blocking entrance into the Dragon Tower vanish.
Only the players of the defending team can enter through the shield.
Recover HP/MP/AG around the guardian statue and recovery rate can be upgraded up to maximum of 3 stages.
The Guardian statues have defensive power/durability (HP) and can only be attacked during the siege. Weapon durability is greatly reduced when attacking the Guardian statues, therefore it is strongly advised to take a Potion of Bless or Soul before attacking.
Guardian statues can be upgraded up to a maximum of 3 stages of defensive power and durability. (upgrading and restoring is not possible during the battle)

## Guard Towers

Guard towers play a role in protecting the Guardian statues once the battle starts.
Guard towers attack invading parties around them.
Guard towers can be attacked just like Guardian statues or Castle gates.

### Citadel

![](public/img/posts/castle-siege/cannon-tower.jpg)

- It will protect the guardian stone statue next to the guardian stone statue after the war starts.
  \*It will not be destroyed even if it is attacked, so it is considered as the "Fortress of God".

\*It can act as a bunker for the defensive side during the battle, and slow down the progress of the attacker during the siege battle, especially its indestructible characteristics are worth making good use of.

## Registering the official seal

The upper floor of the Dragon tower houses a pedestal with the official seal of the lord of the castle.
When the guild master of the alliance succeeds in registering the official seal with the pedestal, their sword symbols will turn into shields and they will now have to defend the castle.
The guild with their official seal registered at the end of the siege will be the lord of the castle.

### The Dragon Tower

![](public/img/posts/castle-siege/dragon-tower.jpg)

is the last huge tower in the inner city. There is a protective film at the entrance to protect the inner city, preventing enemies from entering the Dragon Tower.
For the defenders, Dragon Tower is the last line of defense that can be defended.

There is a seat with the imprint of the city lord on the dragon tower, and entering the dragon tower means that you are only one step away from the victory of the siege battle.

## Condition to win

In order to win, you need to engrave the logo of your alliance on the platform on the top of the dragon tower.

- Only the lord can engrave the Zhanmeng logo on
  the platform - It takes 1 minute to engrave the Zhanmeng logo, if you die during the engraving of the Zhanmeng logo or the 2 cushions under your feet are damaged, the name engraving will fail.
- If the name engraving is over but the siege battle is not yet over, the war will continue, and the positions of the attacking and defending sides will be replaced
  . Santo!

5. Mercenary team:

- The siege side can cooperate with up to 3 coalition alliances, compared with the defenders, they are at a disadvantage in terms of numbers. So the mercenary system is specially designed for the defenders
- mercenaries include javelins and archers, which can be purchased from NPCs in the city.
- There are up to 100 mercenaries, who can be arranged in the area you want. When the siege begins, they are automatically summoned to the pre-designated area and attack the besieger.

![](public/img/posts/castle-siege/mercenaries-archers.jpg)
![](public/img/posts/castle-siege/mercenaries-javelins.jpg)

6. Privileges of holding the city:

When you become the victor, you will obtain the ownership of Roland Canyon City, and you and your allies will also receive certain conveniences and privileges. You and your war alliance will be able to operate castles, collect taxes, and you and your war alliance will also have your own unique leveling and hunting places.

Relevant details will be released successively in the future Miracle Siege X-Files.

More exciting, so stay tuned........

## Chain of command

Members of the siege and defender alliances (including the joint alliance) can see the battle
situation on the siege battlefield through the mini-map at the bottom left of the screen (the left picture below).

- You can see your location, the status of the leader of the war alliance, the expansion map and status of the city in real time.
- Appears when the siege battle starts, and disappears when the siege battle ends or moves to another safe area.
- Use the Tab key to control on/off (the switch of the mini map). Command system (below right picture) Only the leader of the attacking party and the defending party has the right to use it. Through this skill, you can order the
  forward position and attack status of allies
- Use the attack command (knife-shaped Attack), defense command (shield-shaped Defensibly), waiting for the order (flag shape
  Stop) to command the allies.
- Members of the entire alliance can be divided into 7 groups to command

## Stone of Life

![](public/img/posts/castle-siege/stone-of-life.jpg)

Only the leader of the siege party's war alliance can use it. In the case of using the life stone, when the siege party's allies (including the joint alliance) die, they can be resurrected near the battle site (where the life stone is set).

- Normally, if killed in a siege battle, it will be revived outside the city.
- If there is a life stone set, it will be revived near it.
- Only the siege side can use it
  . _ It takes 60 seconds to make a life stone
  . _ With its unique ability, the life stone can help its allies within a range of 3 cells to gain a certain amount of HP, MP, and AG.
- Lifestones can be destroyed by the defending side or the attacking side (forced attack).

Every leader of the war alliance can use it in the joint war alliance, and there is no limit to the number of times it can be used.
\*After the attacking and defending parties change during the siege battle, the new attacking party can use it in time as long as it has the Stone of Life item.

### Creation of the Life Stone

- The stone of life can be obtained through general synthesis
- The synthesis conditions of the stone of life: 5 blessed gems + 5 soul gems + 1 guardian gem + 1 Mayan gem + 5 million gold

## Magic Potion

Blessing Potion and Soul Potion are must-use props when attacking city gates and guarding stone statues.
　　＊When attacking the city gate and guarding the stone statue, if these two potions are not used, the durability of the weapon will decrease sharply.

Features of Blessing Potion:
　　　　　\*Drinking this potion can maintain the effect for 60 seconds at a time. .
　　　　　＊Increased damage by 20% when breaking through city gates and stone statues. PvP will not be affected.

Features of soul potion:
　　　　　*The effect of soul potion can last for 30 seconds.
　　　　　＊AG recovery rate +8.
　　　　　* Improve lightning resistance and ice resistance by 50%.
　　　　　＊Increase attack speed by 20.

How to make the potion:

＊It can be made by general synthesis in Maya Goblin.
　　　＊One blessing gem can generate 5 bottles of blessing potion, and one soul gem can generate 5 bottles of soul potion
　　　. Soul Gem 50,000Zen
　　　＊Put 2 to create 10 bottles of potion, put 5 to make 25 bottles of potion
　　　＊If there is not enough space for item orchid, it cannot be synthesized

How to use the potion:

![](public/img/posts/castle-siege/active-potion.jpg)

Like ordinary potions, you can set Q/W/E shortcut keys. The setting method is to put the mouse on the item and press Ctrl+Q/W/E.
　　　 When using the blessing/soul potion, you can see the icon indicating the effect on the screen. The icon on will also disappear.

## Mercenary System

\*The siege side can cooperate with up to 3 joint alliances, compared to the defenders who are at a disadvantage in terms of numbers. Therefore, the mercenary system is specially designed for the city defenders

- Mercenaries are divided into javelin soldiers and archers, which have different uses when defending the city.

*Mercenaries can be purchased from NPCs in the city (attacking/defending merchant NPCs). *There are up to 100

mercenaries , who can be arranged in the area you want. When the siege begins, they are automatically summoned to the pre-designated area and attack the besieger.

As long as you can master and use the mercenary system proficiently, the defense of the city will surely be even more powerful in the cruel siege battle, and have a greater chance of winning the final victory.

![](public/img/posts/castle-siege/javeliner-mercenary.jpg)

## Spy Side

On the battlefield of the siege battle, besides the attacker and the defender, there is also a mysterious force. They are scattered in every corner of the Roland Canyon, silently participating in every siege battle. They are the heroes on the battlefield. The third party, we can temporarily call them - "spy side".

During the siege, the spies can provide intelligence to both the attacker and the defender, and their special identities bring them a lot of convenience on the battlefield.

The existence of the spies in the siege battle is not simply to observe the battle situation and provide intelligence. Every step they take can turn the world around and turn the whole battle situation upside down.

The so-called neutrality is superficial. As long as you participate in the battle, you must have your own political stance, or join the same enemy with your own side to achieve a great cause, or actually serve as an undercover whistleblower for the other side.

In ancient times, there were "between Zigong", "Cunlu", "Luanqi", "Qiangjin" and "Bayue" which have made a generation of "lifetime" classics.

Now in the city battle, do you pledge your allegiance to Mingjun, or commit yourself to the enemy to spy on undercover agents...

However, you will not be allowed to do whatever you want on the battlefield. The special status of the spy side determines that he cannot do whatever he wants like the offensive and defensive sides.

The battlefield is ruthless, and the guns have no eyes. Be careful of the stray bullets on the battlefield. Have you seen the siege weapons below? It is not fun to be hit by the big stones they throw.

### Siege weapons

The siege weapons are placed at the respective fields of the invading and defending teams.
Click siege weapons to view the menu to select the attacking location.
Players can view the location being attacked when using the siege weapons.

![](public/img/posts/castle-siege/siege-catapult.jpg)
![](public/img/posts/castle-siege/siege-catapult-2.jpg)

Spy side special settings:

1. The spy party can enter Roland Canyon to watch the siege battle without declaring war and verification.

2. The spies must press "ctrl" to attack others.

3. After the death of the spies, they will be revived from the resurrection point of the Brave Continent .

The siege is imminent, the grass and trees are all soldiers, the rumors are groundless, and the authenticity is doubtful.
For siege warfare, every word and phrase in the air is just the most basic and superficial intelligence.

The operation of the city of Roland, the monsters in the place of training, new combat skills, and more props and equipment, these are the things that really affect the battle situation, and are extremely important to both the attacker and the defender.

In the next season of The Siege X-Files, all doubts will be cleared up here.

At the end of the "groundless rumors", I selected an excellent manuscript "Prediction of the Impact on Miracles after the Opening of Miracle Siege War" by a player , and shared it with everyone.

This article briefly summarizes the changes that will occur in the Miracle World in terms of occupations, alliances, bonus points, markets, etc. after the opening of the siege warfare. Maybe, you can also get some inspiration from it.

## Castle Siege Skills

According to legend But because these arcane arts are too cruel and powerful, the great leader decided to seal these arcane arts forever. Gradually with the passage of time, more and more powerful esoteric secret books have been lost. Almost no one would use the tricks that once terrified the enemy. Only those warriors who lived in seclusion in the depths of the Miracle Continent and survived the last siege battle still kept these ancient secrets.

As the siege approached, those old men realized that for the future of Miracle Continent, these arcane arts should be unsealed again.

As a result, powerful and uncontrollable moves such as "Half Moon Slash", "Whirling Blade", "Heaven's Arrow", "Wind Dance Whirling Slash", "Phantom Beam", and "Holy Flame" spread throughout the Miracle Continent again. ．．．．．
