Castle Siege event and skills to use there.

This version came in 10 days:

### Day 1

Dark Lord

The coming of the Dark Lord and the appearance of the mysterious Demon King Quinton will simultaneously sound the trumpet of the great decisive battle of Miracle (MU) in 2005-the prelude to the siege!

Tailored for siege warfare, the Dark Lord has launched a huge and splendid blueprint for siege warfare for everyone with his strong team combat leadership ability and attractive pet system.

This is far from over, it's just the beginning!

Starting from this issue, we will give a systematic and comprehensive introduction to the Holy Tutor profession for the majority of players.

If you have your own opinions on the topics of each issue, please write them in text and send them to our contribution mailbox: service@zhaouc.com , and share them with all players! Once you are officially recognized, your beautiful essay will be published on the official homepage, and you will get weekly cards and other rewards!

Come on together!

![fist Dark Lord photo](public/img/posts/dark-lord-first-image.jpg)
![fist Dark Lord with Dark Master Set](public/img/posts/dark-lord-dark-master.jpg)

The theme of this issue

Including the conditions for generating a Dark Lord, basic attribute points, distribution of upgrade points, basic calculation formulas, and conditions for wearing other professional weapons and equipment, etc.

Through the introduction of this issue, I believe you will be able to have a plan for how to create this king profession and how to make him grow!

### Day 2

The Lost Map and Gate of Kalima

Kalima Temple, also known as the "Lost Map". In the year when humans officially started the war with the demons, it was captured by the demons, and soon disappeared strangely on the Miracle Continent.

According to an old man, his grandfather's grandfather once saw the temple disappear with his own eyes. It flashed a red light in the sky and never appeared again. Only an evil laugh echoed over the sky where it vanished...

Hundreds of years later, a group of strangely dressed people appeared where the temple disappeared. They claimed to be disciples of the Kalima Temple. They claim to have found a way to restore the temple to the Wonderland.

If someone can re-enter Kalima and destroy the demon king Quinton who hides in it, that warrior will receive unforeseen rewards in addition to the highest honor!

However, this mission is so arduous, the first step into Kalima is almost the beginning of the road to death!

Because the monsters inside, even Arcas who guards the gate, are ten times more terrifying than the Omen Feinis...

![Kalima map](public/img/posts/map_kalima.jpg)

The topic of this issue

Including the level difference of entering the Kalima Temple, the method of entering the Kalima Temple and related props, and some difference settings between the Kalima Temple and other maps, etc.

Before you enter the Kalima Temple, please read the topic of this issue carefully, it will tell you how to invade this land that has been occupied by demons, and how to start your adventure.

### Day 3

Dark Lord items

Predicting that the Holy Mentor is about to lead mankind to launch a counterattack against the Demon King Quinton, the goddess prepares special weapons and armor for the Holy Mentor.

Goddesses never seem to create items with such care. Each one uses rare materials in the world.

Do you want to choose a set of visually striking and powerful equipment for your newborn teacher?

This issue's topic "Sacred Armor" will introduce you to all the special weapons and equipment of the Holy Teacher. Each of them has its own extraordinary origin, and of course, it also has its own extraordinary power!

#### Item Compatibility for Wearing Swordsmen:

You haven't had enough training as a freshman Holy Teacher. Seems like a wishful thinking to get a full set of Saint Instructor exclusive items.

The goddess had already thought of this, and she selected some items from other professions, although they were not very luxurious, but they were very suitable for the holy teacher to hone her own wearing items in the early stage.

With these compatible items, the Holy Teacher can take the first steps of his great journey!

#### The Divine Soldiers of the Holy Teacher:

The weapon that the Holy Mentor has is not a sword, not a knife, not a staff, not any of the types of weapons that have appeared in the Marvel world.

As the leader of mankind, the Holy Teacher has a weapon that embodies its powerful potential - the Scepter

### Day 4

Kalima

Kalima has become a lonely island since it was sealed into time and space hundreds of years ago by Quinton, the messenger of darkness and the king of the demons.

Quinton brought some puppet creatures into this lonely world to guard him day and night, preparing him for his terrible plot.

However, there are still many creatures in Kalima that are not demons, but believers or small lives that have lived in Kalima for generations. The huge environmental turmoil has changed these creatures, and they have taken an extremely hostile attitude towards all alien life .

But they still dream that one day they can return to the Miracle Continent and live an ordinary life.

Who knows, maybe the ultimate hero who can help these poor creatures fulfill their wishes and completely undo Quinton's "Dark Key" plot is you!

#### Kalima monsters

If your heart is full of passion for exploration, then you must have been collecting "Quinton Marks" everywhere by now. Even, you have entered the tortuous river channel of the Kalima Temple and started your journey to death...

But warriors, blindness is not a good quality. Before you know what obstacles and enemies you will encounter, it is best to read this intel that was exchanged for the lives of the disciples of the Temple of Kalima...

The theme of this issue is "Dance of Demons", introducing the basic attributes, skills and distribution of 7 kinds of monsters in the 6 levels of Kalima Temple.

Hope you are prepared enough to boost your confidence when the warriors invade Kalimar!

Maybe it's wrong to call all their "people" "monsters," because some of them are really kind.

But what I want to say next is that it is not so much an analysis of the enemy as it is listening to some wonderful stories one by one...

### Day 5

Growing up is a difficult process, but it is also full of joy of discovery. Every time you learn a new skill, the urge to try it is enough to destroy any difficulties that lie in front of you at that moment.

The growth of the holy teacher will also go through this process.

As the favored son of the goddess, the Holy Teacher has a completely different skill system from ordinary people. All the skills are for one purpose: to gather the power of all warriors and deal the greatest blow to the forces of darkness.

The holy teacher gradually understood a truth in the process of his continuous growth: he is the leader, but the leader is not the strongest himself.

Holy Teacher, make everyone stronger!

The theme of this issue is "The Growth of the Holy Teacher", which introduces you in detail every step in the growth process of the Holy Teacher.

"Shock Wave", "Nebula Fire Chain", "Deadly Seal"... Each brand new skill recorded every drop of blood and sweat of the Holy Teacher.

What skills does an ultimate leader need? The answer is revealed below!

### Day 6

Is it the source of evil in this world?

The answer is not certain. Because according to the Goddess, he is only the messenger of darkness, the seducer of evil.

One thing is certain, the Demon Lord Quinton is always preparing to introduce the power of darkness into this world. His gaze was fixed on the door of darkness.

Once the door is opened, the world will become a paradise of darkness and evil, and this is the moment he worships. The moment he called "the real beginning of the world"!

Well, warriors, your enemies are finally coming face to face with you. The weapons in your hands are for the future of this world, and so are you.

Defeating him is your responsibility, of course, it is your honor, in addition to engraved inscriptions through the ages, there will be unexpected surprises waiting for you! But the premise is that you have enough strength and wisdom to defeat this said to be the "myth of immortality" - the demon king Quinton!

### Day 7

Not only does the gathering of human warriors make the team stronger, but for the Holy Teacher herself, the Goddess also spares no effort to endow him with various magical powers. Among them, the dark summoning ability of summoning pets "Skyhawk" and "Black King Horse" is a new magic ability that cannot be matched by other professions.

And the unique flying tool "King's Cloak" not only allows the holy teacher to fight in the air, but also its appearance can not be sighed without a word-cool!

Goddess, it's not ordinary to dress up her favored son in an imposing manner.

The flying eagle, the majestic black king horse, and the fluttering king's cloak. When the holy teacher controls these three magic weapons and gallops across the battlefield, a mature leader will open a new chapter of miracles!

### Day 8

The Continent of the Brave, the Fairy Trail Forest, Icewind Valley... Recently, some people wearing unfamiliar armor and holding strange weapons gradually appeared. They are not holy teachers, but just some knights, magisters, holy archers and magic swordsmen.

Some of them swaggered, some cautiously. There is only one thing in common, that is, they have attracted the attention of countless people.

What are these strange clothes and weapons? What unknown mysterious powers do they have?

The theme of this issue After reading this topic, do you have a new understanding and confidence in the career that you have poured your heart and soul into?

![](public/img/posts/099y-new-sets-day-8.jpg)

#### Knight's Treasure:

The red armor made of fire dragon skeletons, the mysterious ancient knife that can cut off the moonlight... The ancient knights condensed all their romance and bravery into this brand new treasure.

If you are a knight, you must be proud that your profession can have such elegant and upright armor and weapons...

### Day 9

Like all professions, no matter how proud a holy teacher is, he also needs to choose his own path of growth.

The ability of the holy teacher is not infinite. When he chooses his partner, he also chooses his own future. There is only one road, and hardship and glory are indeed the same.

Will your holy mentor be a mighty general with a staff? Or a wise man surrounded by a dazzling magical aura? Or the handsome man who commands thousands of troops, spins the sky eagle and straddles the black horse? !

No matter what, you need to know how to be the leader and stand alone. Today's topic is to show you the various paths of development that the Holy Teacher will be able to take. At least, it can give you some inspiration for your future growth path.
