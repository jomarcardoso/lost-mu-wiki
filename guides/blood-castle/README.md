Risk your life to save the Archangel

One of the strongest warriors in the Continent of MU, the Archangel; has secretly been laying watch over the lands that he has sworn to protect. As Kundun's presence approaches, the archangel has been warding off all the monsters trying to invade the Continent of MU. But alas, our Guardian Archangel can not fend on his own forever.

Kundun's Army has invaded his Castle and has overcome the strength of the Archangel.

The Archangel, injured and in peril; summons forth the warriors of MU, to come aid him in his most dire time of need. Unable to summon his strengths without his Divine Weapon of Archangel, you have been asked to infiltrate this now over ridden Castle and retrieve his weapon for him.

However, only with the Cloak of Invisibility will you be allowed onto the Castle grounds.

Fight! Blood Castle!

Text/Suzaku.Aya

Act 1: Hint of the transparent cloak - I will be the hero! I want everyone to witness!

Act Two: Looking for the Archangel's Footsteps - The sleeping Archangel lies quietly on the top of the ice and fire.

The third act: Waving the weapon in your hand, rubbing shoulders with the god of death when you stand side by side with your comrades--the demons! Have you forgotten that I still have many friends?

Act Four: Man, is the strong man, and the door, is the door of evil. ——In the face of strong walls and death, we are still moving forward bravely. Through that evil door, one can feel the divine light emanating from within.

Act V: The living are warriors, and the dead are heroes—I only saw the crystal coffin that sealed the weapons that could dominate the world. You ask me where is the enemy? They have fallen with my dead companions.

Act Six: The soul of the saint, the long-cherished wish of the angel, the victory of mankind, the flight of the devil - did we save the archangel, or did the archangel save us...

Act 1: Hint of the transparent cloak - I will be the hero! I want everyone to witness!

### Plot

I don't know when, many bloody skeletons and books filled with unintelligible words appeared in this world. I don't know when, the Blood Castle appeared at a certain end of the world. In short, there are more and more rumors. The magister of the Brave Continent said that the skeleton is called the "Skull of the Blood Spirit" and the book is called the "Book of the Blood Spirit". He also said that by synthesizing these two items, an unexpected item can be obtained. What is that? If you get it—then you have the chance to become a hero! Everyone, including me, will have an impulse when I see the transparent cloak full of mystery after synthesis - I will be a hero! I want everyone to witness!

[Strategy]
It is the same as all the previous synthesis methods (you can refer to the entrance ticket for Synthesizing Devil Square), you need to collect all the "Blood Spirit Skull", "Blood Spirit Book", plus a Mayan gem, you can go to Maya Synthesize at Goblin, after synthesis, there will be 80% chance to appear the pass to enter Blood Castle - transparent cloak. The synthesized transparent cloak depends on the level of "Blood Spirit Skull" and "Blood Spirit Book". The synthesis process of different levels requires different prices, ranging from 8,000 MU coins to 160,000 MU coins. I believe that the player must have enough MU coins to exchange for this precious ticket to the Blood Castle, because the player can calculate carefully, if he successfully enters the Blood Castle, how much chance will he have to obtain it, which is much better than a one-time payment Double the value too! Experience, money, gems, equipment, many opportunities, high probability... What will it mean if everyone works together to break through the encirclement of the enemy, break open the old gate, and smash the crystal-like coffin?
Act Two: Looking for the Archangel's Footsteps - The sleeping Archangel lies quietly on the top of the ice and fire.

[Story]
People wearing transparent cloaks will always feel that there is a powerful force calling them to the direction of Icewind Dale. Who will be there? What will happen there? Many people said that a strange man appeared in the cathedral of Icewind Dale, and he knelt for a long time surrounded by a sacred halo. It seemed that he was waiting for something. And when the person he was waiting for got there, what would happen? Mysteries were dedicated to the strange atmosphere of Icewind Dale, until one day, when countless people and I, dressed in all kinds of dazzling equipment from the Miracle Continent, came to this beautiful white scene almost at the same time, all the mysteries were solved .

"The sleeping archangel lies quietly on the ice and fire. Heroes who save the world, raise your weapons and go to complete the most sacred mission!"

He spoke, and then an earth-shattering shout came from my side. Turning around, I saw countless swordsmen, knights, magicians, magisters, archers, and holy archers rushing towards the cathedral. They were all wearing the kind of transparent cloak that suddenly appeared in this world, and suddenly found that this cloak seemed to be guiding their route, the goal——Blood Castle!

[Strategy]
Due to the distortion of time and space, a total of 6 Blood Castles appeared (in order to allow all players to feel the hearty and extremely thrilling Blood Castle, in the game according to the level of the players, there are 6 levels of players. There are 6 Blood Castles with different difficulties), and the time for each Blood Castle strategy is 15 minutes, and there are 24 opening times per day, and the opening time is the 30th minute of each hour. Bring enough blood bottles and magic bottles, as well as arrows and crossbows. It is recommended that archers reserve more arrows and crossbows, because if they have enough confidence and strength, they will easily run out of arrows and crossbows in the end.

Players choose the transparent cloak they can use according to their level, and store it in their warehouse. Before opening the mysterious passage of Blood Castle, take the available transparent cloak with you, go to the cathedral on the left side of Icewind Dale Town, enter the door, and you can see the messenger of the archangel who suddenly descended there ( Coordinates: Icewind Dale[209, 30] or Icewind Dale[219, 9]). Click on the envoy, and if you wear a transparent cloak that suits your level, you can enter a selection box and choose the level of Blood Castle that you can enter.

When the player presses the button to enter the Blood Castle, he will suddenly appear on a stone field not far from the Blood Castle, where he can see the unconscious archangel and his messenger, as well as a The long and narrow passage leads all the way to the inner fort of the Blood Castle. Players will fight desperately with a large number of elite troops of the demon army on this road of death.
The third act: Waving the weapon in your hand, rubbing shoulders with the god of death when you stand side by side with your comrades--the demons! Have you forgotten that I still have many friends?

[Plot]
I was also brought to the cathedral in Icewind Dale by a powerful force, and I showed the transparent cloak with magical power floating on my body to the messenger of the archangel in front of me. It was only a few seconds of dizziness and darkness. When I opened my eyes, I was already standing in a very strange place. There was no daylight, no fresh air, and no colorful mountains and rivers here.

Horrible ridicules came over me. Facing the elite troops of an army of demons, I really had no chance of winning... I walked to the narrow passage, took a deep breath, and faced pairs of blood-red eyes , Am I going to rush in alone?

At this time, waves of heat radiated from behind him, and the colorful lights from the gorgeous equipment illuminated the lifeless land. One by one, the warriors who were holding back their energy appeared around me one after another. I smiled... Those familiar faces, they are all my best friends after years of dating. Today, we will fight for humanity! I was the first to swing the sharp blade that could slay a dragon, and strode towards the long and narrow passage.

[Strategy]
Each battlefield can accommodate up to 15 players, and each team can have up to five members. And every time a player is added, the number of monsters necessary to kill will increase accordingly. According to the number of players entering, the siege troops are required to kill the number of players multiplied by 40 monsters (for example: 5 players need to kill 200 monsters before you can start attacking the city gate). Therefore, being able to have the strongest combat effectiveness with the least number of people is the key to successfully completing the Blood Castle mission. Because there is not enough time, because our purpose here is not just to survive. To become a hero or save the world, we must break through the difficulties set by the demons and go straight to the yellow dragon—recapture the weapon of the archangel.

Players do not need to approach the city gate step by step when attacking the narrow passage. It is recommended to wipe out all the enemies that need to be eliminated in the shortest time. Although enemies will continue to appear, at this time it is recommended that players store their weapons in the warehouse around them (especially for archers, the computer will default to attacking enemies at the far end and go around to the back through the gaps in the monster bushes), so that you can It is very convenient to shuttle through this long and narrow passage. Although the enemy will continue to attack, they can break through this long and narrow passage very quickly. It is recommended that the blood cows be the first ones, and the blood cows be the ones who are broken. They can absorb as much energy as possible. Part of the enemy's attack, but in the middle there must be a mage to protect the omniscient elves, and the elves are protected from the front and back in the middle, and they can also increase the attack, defense and blood of the comrades in front and behind.

According to the characteristics of monsters, try to get close to those places where there are no or few long-range troops around to kill monsters, because this can minimize your own losses. Area magic and area skills will have a great effect at this time, warriors Guys, use all your strength to break through the siege!
Act IV: Man, is the strong man, door, is the door of evil. ——In the face of strong walls and death, we are still moving forward bravely. Through that evil door, one can feel the divine light emanating from within.

[Plot]
From the moment I stepped into the long, narrow and dark passageway with a dragon-slaying knife, I decided to forget everything about myself, and the only belief I kept was—to break through the siege, Break down the gate, crush the coffin, take back the treasure, and save the world!

Although there are only a few comrades-in-arms around, I always feel that there is a powerful force taking care of us. Maybe this is the prayer of the archangel! Occasionally, when I look back, the bloody battles of my comrades pass by the corner of my eyes, the shocking moments, and the heart-piercing screams... I don't dare to watch anymore, I turn around and continue to charge...

Who gave me the will not to fall? When I ran in front of the evil door, I finally erupted with unprecedented power. The holy light filled the entire Blood Castle, and I looked back at the only two remaining companions behind me. After a roar, we rushed towards the gate where the evil barriers gathered...

[Strategy]
At this juncture, everyone should have consumed more than half of it. It's just that you must save your own strength at this time. After successfully eliminating the number of monsters set for the mission in the narrow passage, it is recommended to go straight to the gate that blocks the warriors' progress. Survivors should use the most powerful single attack magic or skills to deal the most devastating blow to it. And there are many monsters behind that will harass the player's door-slamming process. If there are many people, you can send one person to deal with it. If there are not enough people, you should work together to fight the city gate. will chase in. However, after the city gate is completely broken, you must first check how much you have in stock. If it is too small, then the duel at the top will be very difficult.

Act V: The living are warriors, and the dead are heroes—I only saw the crystal coffin that sealed the weapons that could dominate the world. You ask me where is the enemy? They have fallen with my dead companions.

[Plot]
The door of evil has been opened, but what greets us is the end. Companions fell one after another, no one could hold on to that deadly attack. And I continued to sprint on the bloody road that my companions had exchanged for their own lives, and finally approached the crystal coffin emitting absolute zero at the last moment. Behind me, I can still feel the ubiquitous prayer of the archangel, and on my body, there is still the magic power of the elf who died to cover my last God of War power, and in front of me, the crystal coffin appeared There was an obvious crack, and in an instant, the light covered the black mist of Blood Castle. I found the weapon that soars in the air, the legendary weapon that can rule the world.

[Strategy]
After breaking through that door, there is no chance for the player to breathe. In order to avoid the pursuit of those long-range troops on the passage behind, the player will rush into the hall of Blood Castle immediately, but if the player enters here for the first time, it may be It will suffer the most devastating blow, because there are still many enemies inside, and they are all boss-level monsters, they guard the crystal coffin. At this time, the players may not have many resources with them, and may not have much time. At this time, players should not flee in all directions due to sudden heavy damage. What is needed most at this time is to calm down and find a way to regroup, otherwise it will be easy to be defeated by monsters one by one. Everyone still has the opportunity to work together to deal with the enemy one by one. After killing 10 monsters, the enchantment of the crystal coffin will be completely broken, and the player can rush towards the place where the crystal coffin is placed. Time is running out at that time, players should go all out to deal with the indestructible crystal coffin, don't worry about the enemies behind, just ensure their own existence, it is worthwhile to put one more attack point on the crystal coffin. Not long after, the crystal coffin was completely shattered, and the player can pick up the weapon of the archangel on the ground and evacuate this bloody place (it is indeed the best of the best, with excellent six attributes, but unfortunately, the player cannot use it at all) Such a weapon is nothing more than a prop, can such a weapon only be used by an archangel?).

Scene 6: The soul of the saint, the long-cherished wish of the angel, the victory of mankind, the escape of the devil—we saved the archangel, or the archangel saved us... [Plot] I suddenly felt very quiet, as if the battle

just
ended In a flash, I picked up this top-level weapon of the archangel, and seeing the blood of my comrades flowing on it, my tears instantly broke through the barriers in my eyes. Huo Di, I turned my back, every step I took was splashing with memories of the past, friendship, family, love... Finally, after walking through the long and narrow passage of death, I gently handed the weapon in my hand to the closed door. The archangel of the eyes, I know that in this almost crazy battle, he gave us infinite prayers.

Watching the archangel's eyes slowly open, watching him raise the top-level weapon that only he can use, and seeing him lightly wave it, the bloody castle is like a three-dimensional mirror, shattered .

The world quietly returned to calm, as if nothing had happened, and the archangel finally regained his vitality. He waved his wings lightly, and disappeared from my sight... I recalled all the comrades who died in battle At this time, I really don't know whether we saved the Archangel or the Archangel saved us... [Strategy] Don't think that you have successfully completed

this
task by picking up the top weapon of the Archangel. Oh mission. Because you will find that the monsters present have not flinched because of this, take the weapons you have taken, and fight out with your partners!

The method is still the same as before, just retreat after lining up the formation. If the player responsible for keeping the Archangel's top weapon dies unfortunately during the evacuation, the weapon will fall out, picked up by other partners around him, and rush outward like a baton. If he didn't want to kill a few monsters before going out, the time must be running out, and the potion he was carrying should be almost used up. As for the method of rushing out, it is the same as the method of entering. Take off the weapon and click on the distance, and the character will naturally bypass the monster in front of him and run towards the outside.
