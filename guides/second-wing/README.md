# Second Wings

> In August 2003, around the patch 0.95, after class upgrade the level 2 wings appeared.

With the possibility to upgrade the characters to them second classes,
[Blade Knight](/character/dark_knight#upgrade),
[Soul Master](/character/dark_wizard#upgrade),
[Muse Elf](/character/elf#upgrade), came the second wing too, that are stronger
evolution of the first wings and require higher levels to equip.

![Darkness Wings](public/img/items/wings/wings-of-darkness.webp)

At this first moment, these 4 wings were all the 2nd wings available to do, because
there were not more characters at that time. See at the end others 2nd wings, capes and cloaks.

## Create the wing

Before make the second wings, you must have already made the 1st wing, because the
first wing is an ingredient to the 2nd wings. [See how to make your first wing](/guide/first-wing.)
Other two special items are [Loch's Feather](/item/lochs-feather) and [Chrest of Monarch](/item/crest-of-monarch)
that determines if the result will be a wing or a cape, where [Loch's Feather](/item/lochs-feather)
is for wings and [Chrest of Monarch](/item/crest-of-monarch) to make capes.

To create a second wing, put the following items in the Chaos Machine in Noria.

- 1 [First Wing](/item/first-wing) +4 (minimum) + 4 option (minimum);
- 1 [Jewel of Chaos;](/item/jewel_of_chaos)
- 1 [Loch's Feather](/item/lochs-feather) or [Chrest of Monarch;](/item/crest-of-monarch)
- 1 excellent equipment (optional) +4 (minimum) + 4 option (minimum) to increase
  the succesfull chance.

The result is one of the flowing:
