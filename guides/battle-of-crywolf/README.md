# Battle of Crywolf

In order to prevent Quinton's forces, the noble alliance <Arka> established the Wolf Soul Fortress in the southeast of Roland Canyon as a pre-war base. Therefore, Quinton's army, which was going straight to the Brave Continent, was hindered by the Wolf Soul Fortress, and had to temporarily suspend its attack on the Brave Continent. In order to restore the war situation in a state of negotiation, it issued a military order to the army of the Demon Realm to capture the fortress. The demon army led by Bacchus racked his brains to think about how to capture this legendary fortress, and Bakas also sent specially trained scouts to patrol the fortress every day, trying to find the fatal weakness of the fortress. After a long period of reconnaissance, Bakas finally discovered that the power to protect the fortress actually comes from the God of War Wolf in the center of the fortress. At the same time, they discovered a phenomenon that the power of the God's seat would inexplicably become weak once a week. So Bacchus decided to attack the Wolf Soul Fortress while the power of the God Throne weakened.

    3 - 3 Wolf God

ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

The huge guardian statues handed down from the elves and made with the power of ancient times have the power to prevent the approach of evil beings, so Quinton's men can't approach them casually. However, the power of the God of War Wolf Throne weakened every week, and Quinton's subordinates headed by Bakar took this opportunity to attack the fortress. In order to defend against their attacks, five divine wolf guards were built around the seat of God, and once the guards were destroyed, they would lose their power to protect the Wolf Soul Fortress.

    3 - 4 God Wolf Guard

ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

To empower and protect the Wolf God Seat, only the elves who are the source of their power can give power to the God Wolf Guard. Once the god wolf guard is destroyed, the war wolf seat will lose its strength, and the monster army led by Bacchus will mobilize all means to destroy the god wolf guard. The warriors' protection of the guard and the elves guarding the guard are the key to the success of the battle.

    3 - 5 Bound God Wolf Guard

    [Picture 1-1 The appearance of the god wolf guard]

    1) Bindable roles

5 Holy Archers above level 350

A Divine Wolf Guard that is being bound by a Holy Archer cannot be bound by another Holy Archer at the same time.

    2) The number of times that can be bound

Up to 2 times, a divine wolf guard ends 2 bindings and cannot be bound again.

Binding failures relate to either of the following:

â‘  The character being bound moves to the outside of the wolf guard

â‘¡ The character being bound dies

    3) Binding time

After the start of the stronghold campaign, add icons to the characters that can be bound

After 5 seconds after logging in with the God Wolf Guard, it can affect the God of War Wolf Seat.

    4) Create a protective film

The defensive film of the Wolf God Seat is generated according to the value of the character in the God Wolf Armor being bound.

â‘  Initial state without binding

    Defense Membrane HP = 0

â‘¡ The status of binding start

    Defensive Membrane HP = Sum of HP of bound characters

    5) Defense Membrane HP

According to the HP reduction of the character bound to the God Wolf Guard, the HP of the God Wolf Guard will be reduced by the same amount

The number of characters bound to the wolf guard will affect the stage of the defensive film, and the characters bound with the stage of the defensive film will reduce the hit value received by the monster by a certain percentage.

| number of people | Hit value reduction rate |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1                | 0%                       |
