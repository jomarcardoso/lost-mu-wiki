# Atlans

The once beautiful Ocean of Atlans, became inhabited by one of Kundun's Strongest Monsters, the Hydra. The Hydra then summoned several sea monsters to guard the pathway to Tarkan. Atlans is on the southern part of Noria and is not for the weak. The Treasures of Atlans is guarded by the Hydra for a reason.

- **level limit:** Character level 60 and above may walk to Atlans but must be 70 and above to warp there. Characters with level 5 Gloves and above may utilize a faster swimming speed as they race through Atlans.
- **features:** Strong adventurers may challenge the Hydra and his army of sea monsters. Though not all will survive, those who do are astounding.

The Atlans is a dangerous underwater world! Once a great ancient city, it now lies in ruins due to Kundunâ€™s invasion. Fearsome sea creatures have swarmed into what remains, and vicious Hydra has been spotted lurking in the deepest depths of these waters, awaiting to attack prey.

Atlantis is a mysterious empire sleeping in the seabed of the miracle continent, a gorgeous and bright pearl in the water. Players must reach level 60 to enter here. Here, the player has a brand new action - swimming.

The monsters in Atlantis, from the weakest little Bahamut to the evil and alien demon king Hitler, are all full of the grotesque colors of the underwater world.

Go out from the door in the direction of 1:00 in the safe area, swim straight along the road, and you can gradually go deep into Atlantis. First up is Little Bahamut and the Death Mermaid, the weakest monster on the bottom of the sea. Going deeper, there will be a blue-winged sea monster emitting blue light all over its body. Not long after the first right turn, you can see groups of blue-winged sea monsters gathered near a piece of aquatic plants, which is an excellent exercise grade place. Continuing down are Silver Bow, Bahamut, the Wizard King and the BOSS "Sea Demon Hitler" under the sea.

Starting from Bahamut, it is recommended that swordsmen with a level of 140 or above and Zhibow with an intelligence of 600 or above form a team to enter, but the wizard king's drop treasure is not very ideal.

As for the sea demon Hitler, it is best to use it only for treasure hunting and leveling, or find another good place.

Behind the beautiful fairy forest, Noria , there was a dark deep sea called Atlans
, like Janus

... Originally, Atlans was a peaceful world out of reach of Kundun's forces.
... That peace is broken by the greed of Kundun's men.

... Kundun had one of the eight sealing stones scattered across the continent of Mu
... and he appointed the most vicious Hydra as the commander of the guard and no one
...made it inaccessible.

... However, Hydra could not overcome the temptation of Etramu, the sealing stone symbolizing Kundun's powerful power, and
stole it away.

... He obtained strong power and magic with the possession of the stolen Etramu, but fearing Kundun's retaliation
... led his men to hide in the peaceful Atlans off the coast of Noria and claim himself as the king of the deep sea

Level limit: Those who have formed a party of 60 or more.
... How to move: Walking and running are possible only in the safety zone, and moving underwater is by swimming.

... There are no merchants in the safe zone like in the dungeon.

... There are powerful monsters called seaworms hiding here and there.
