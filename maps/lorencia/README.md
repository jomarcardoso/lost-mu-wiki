The Brave Continent is located in the center of the Miracle Continent. It is rainy
all year round, the climate is humid and hot, and the plants are composed of grassland

The Brave Continent is located in the center of the Miracle Continent. It is rainy all the year round, and the climate is humid and hot. Plants are made of grass filled with a dark and eerie atmosphere. The number of NPCs here is the largest of all maps. Because the location is a traffic hub, it is also the place where the most players gather.

With the central village as the center, the entire Brave Continent moves clockwise, and can be divided into four directions: 1 o'clock, 4 o'clock, 7 o'clock and 10 o'clock. The levels of various monsters also gradually increase: 4 o'clock is the habitat of the lowest spider and young dragon; 7 o'clock is the young dragon and bull monster; There are giants entrenched near the entrance to Icewind Dale. At 1 o'clock is the entrance of the dungeon, where there are black wizards who can attack long-distance meteorites and the most powerful monster in the Brave Continentâ€”the skeleton monster.

This is where swordsmen, magicians, magic swordsmen and holy teachers were born. Suitable for occupations before level 30 to level up here. The pubs in town are great places for warriors to meet and talk. After cultivating here to level 30, generally speaking, one can enter Icewind Dale.
