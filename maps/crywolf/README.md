# Crywolf

Crywolf is said to play an important role in the game as the only map that can be
accessed from all subordinate servers, just like the siege server. It also has the
characteristics of being the residence of powerful monsters, werewolves. Then...
when you enter the map, aren't wolves echoing everywhere? It's creepy just thinking
about it. This is the real secret. In the QA (test team) tested in Crywolf, some
people actually became werewolves, and they say that they turn into werewolves
after 12 o'clock.. Did you know.. All men are wolves? is not an adult, so please
come with adult certification.)

Scouts from Kundun scouting around Crywolf Fortress. Together with various espionage
activities, they carry out sabotage operations. They have fast movement speed and
have various types of attack patterns according to their characteristics, so the
short-range type uses a mace, the mid-range type uses a bow, and the long-range
type uses a bow.

Werewolf: A dark knight who rules the night in Crywolf. In the form of huge wolves,
they roam in packs, attacking travelers and taking their blood and flesh. They often
shout loudly to encourage their comrades in battle, and the name Crywolf is derived from this.

It can be said that it is a monster suitable for the Crywolf Fortress, which is
completely different from the concept of the existing monsters. But aren't there
werewolves? I'll go up to the development team later and ask.

Basic Backstory

Located in the southeast of Roland Canyon, it is the frontline fortress of the Human-Elf United Army fighting against the Quinton forces. The Wolf Soul Fortress located among the cliffs has become Tianhui's fortress and strategic location based on the difficult terrain and human efforts.

Due to the obstruction of the Wolf Soul Fortress, Quinton's forces are still unable to advance northward and the front line is also at a stalemate. In order to break the deadlock, Kun Dun gave Lei Muer the instruction to send an elite division to the Wolf Soul Fortress.
