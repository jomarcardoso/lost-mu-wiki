The desert of death leading to the dark underground city of Kantur... The long-dormant
desert has awakened.

The abandoned land is called the desert of death. It is the link between Kanturu and Atlans,
an underground city built by the Atlantes. Kanturin, a strict class society, drives mutants,
who are mutants, to Tarkan, and throws away the failures of their biological experiments in Tarkan.

The Forgotten Desert is a deserted land of death. Players can enter Atlantis through the fairy forest, and then enter the death desert from Atlantis. Or go directly to the desert of death through the mobile shortcut menu.

The minimum level to enter the Death Desert is level 140.

Compared with other maps before, the monsters in the desert of death are obviously much stronger. Among them, the Destruction Knight, Black Balrog, Zakan, and Blazing Devil located in the north and northeast of the Death Desert are some treasure-hunting hotspots where top-quality equipment drops very frequently.

Apart from the difficulty of the monsters, the most worrying thing is that there are no wandering traders in the desert. And you who came to the desert through the whole of Atlantis must have consumed a lot of potions on the way, and it will be very difficult without enough potions here, so bringing enough potions will be extremely important for conquering the desert of death. important premise.
