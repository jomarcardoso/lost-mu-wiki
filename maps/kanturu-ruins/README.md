# Kanturu Ruins

Kanturu Ruins was once a valiant land of natural resources, maintained by the Kantur People. The Kantur People had built a kingdom, now known as Kanturu Relics, deep underground, among this island. However, during Year 1870 of Lugard Kundun was resurrected. Consequently, this tranquil place and the Kanturu Relics were attacked and plundered. Despite it all, the Refinery Tower still stands in the Kanturu Relics, and Elpis remains inside managing the historical tower.
