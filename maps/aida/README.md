# Aida

A hunting ground for mid-level and low-level people! It is said that it is a background
with a bright and dark image that combines the atmosphere of an ancient battlefield
and a beautiful forest. As you can see through the screenshot, I think it's a map
where the expression 'beautiful' comes out. I think this is very welcome news in
that it is a hunting ground for mid-level and low-level users who can move through
Noria and have not been patched in the past. The concept of the map is a primeval
forest abandoned by people due to war that has been devastated for a long time as
a place where the forest clans live.

The witch queen, called the queen of all witches, was not a demon born in the demon
realm, but a witch who lived in the ancient continent of Mu. Having even reached
the limit of magic that can be obtained as a human, she finally came to long for
the power of demons beyond the limits of humans. Through the establishment of the
contract, she obtained an infinite body made of spiritual thoughts. Her greatest
hobby is to seduce and corrupt weak humans using powerful thoughts. The concept
of being seduced and corrupted is like a flower snake (yes, [GM] private thinks
like this -\_-)

Blue Golem: A representative artificial life form of the Demon Realm. Since it is
driven by mana, it instinctively sucks in mana from the surroundings, and it is
said that it instinctively destroys those who stand in its way due to its reckless
tendency. What does it mean to instinctively destroy? That's pretty much killing it. Haha

Death Rider: An elite division of Lemuria, and the main force of the operation to
capture Aida. Using its strong four legs, it employs tactics that make use of its
mobility with its fast movement ability, and cuts down enemies without hesitation
with its scythe-shaped hands.

Forest Orc: Orcs living in the Old Forest of Ida. As descendants of cruel and proud warriors,
they were a race that continued to rebel even after being incorporated into Kundun's
army during the 2nd Demon God War. Even after being incorporated into Lemuria's
Dark Division in the Aida capture operation, he is still attempting a rebellion
for the freedom of his species. Wouldn't I also be assigned to a unit in Kundun
when I was assigned to my own unit at the Nonsan Training Center--?

Death Tree: A tree spirit who lives in the forest of Aida. They were created by
fairies during the war between fairies and black magicians, and after the war,
they have been living independently as one race. Although it is not of a warlike
nature, special care is required when passing through Aida's Forest as it has no
mercy for beings that invade the forest. I wrote a conceptual story, but in fact,
when the forest is invaded, if you stab a little bit, it will take care of it. Like
all societies, this monster may have learned to some degree how to live in a
corrupt society. Haha

Basic Backstory

The place where a large-scale war broke out between the magical kingdom of Arca and the elf kingdom of Fairy Forest on the occasion of the Second Demon War. During the war, because Arka used forbidden magic, a gap appeared in the dark forest, but through this gap, many strange animals, plants and monsters slipped in to form a huge forest.

After that, the Dark Forest became an independent world separated from the outside world for hundreds of years. However, due to poverty, Emur was instructed to march to the Fairy Forest, and the flames of war gradually arose in the Dark Forest.
