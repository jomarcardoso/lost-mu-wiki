Devias is a snowfield located to the north of Lorencia. It is covered with perpetual
snow, and the monsters are more powerful than those in Lorencia or Noria.
Devias is home to several important people, such as Royal Guard Captain Lorence,
Mercenary Guild Manager Tercia, and Sebina The Priest. One of two great castles,
which were erected in the wilderness of Devias, was pillaged by Kundun, during his
resurrection, and is now overtaken with monsters. It is the castle directly north of
town which still maintains control by the Church of Devias. Strong travelers are
known to visit the area, as Devias is the access point for Raklion, a dangerous glacier.

Icewind Dale has its own unique language - ice language. There will be a "rustling" sound when walking on the ground in Icewind Dale. The wind blowing head-on made people feel a chilling air. This is a cold and clean land. Most of the monsters are also blue and white. This is not a place where any career is born. When the character reaches level 15, he can enter Icewind Dale to experience the wholehearted leveling experience.

Like the Fairy Trail Forest, the monsters here are mostly mixed. But it can be roughly divided into four parts: the northern part of the village, roughly in the direction of 3 o'clock, mainly contains snow worms and blue monsters, which are the weakest monsters in Icewind Dale. In the middle of the snow field there are ice fiends, yetis and assassins. Especially the Snowmen and Ice Demons, they move in groups and attack from a distance, so they are the most dangerous places.

The 9 o'clock position is the snowman king area, which is the favorite of the warriors who like to fight the snowman king. Because the terrain is very open, it is an excellent leveling place for magicians and archers.

Finally, in the direction of 12 o'clock, there are snowmen, snowman kings, and the boss of Icewind Dale - the Ice Queen. If you have not reached level 50, I advise you not to take risks.
