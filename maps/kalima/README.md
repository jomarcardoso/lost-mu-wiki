The Temple of Kalima is a map that makes players full of fantasy, where you can burst out the best equipment that has never appeared before. But before you enter, you should first evaluate your own power and see how strong your survivability is on this map.

The 5 editors have tested the sensitive bow + mage + knight + holy teacher + magic sword, among which the 351-level knight is equipped with a full set of +13 chasing 16 supreme equipment, defense 960+, and life nearly 2000.

You can travel unimpeded in the city of the sky, but it is very difficult to come here. Even the lowest-level magic spirit has a maximum attack of 705, a defense of 540, and a life of 62000. No matter how good the equipment is, you will feel it here. The insignificance of personal power.

Only the team is king!

For the first time, everyone chose five attacking professions: Sensitive Bow + Mage + Knight + Holy Tutor + Magic Sword. Unfortunately, the Holy Tutor returned to the city as soon as he went down.

You can imagine the consequences of not having an intelligent MM. Even if there are four strong and powerful people, it is so miserable... (Everyone can casually YY to this string of gorgeous ellipsis).

The second time, even though the holy magician could strengthen the team's fatal damage, everyone still resolutely and unanimously abandoned the useless holy teacher, and a super-intelligent MM joined the team after frantically adding points.

Mage and Sensitive Bow will always be the main attack force, knights as meat shields are the guarantee of safety, and the unique ability of Demon Sword is also one of the important strengths of the team.

This combination is the most stable combination. It is difficult for other occupations except high-defense fighters to withstand the high attacks of monsters here; high-intelligence MMs add attack and defense for everyone; the combination of sensitive bows and mages is to ensure the speed of killing monsters. Bows have the strongest skills against single targets, and mages have the strongest skills against range, which can not only ensure the team's safe leveling and treasure hunting, but also effectively restrain the monster's attack and refresh rate on the team.

The most golden combination is on the stage, but here... Quinton's unfathomable blood and super recovery ability, what else can everyone say.

Big girl, you stand up first, my 351 little knight flashes first...

Five people:

I can only use a poem that I read
with heart.
Please, Quinton, please listen to my sentence and return my sincerity. I hope
you will not dislike
me.
Only three words, all only three
one two three oh I love you
i love you i love you
i love you i love you i love you
i love you
I love you I love you
I love you you you you you you you
come here come let us sing... come let us sing...

Quinton:
If you want to step on you, you can step on it, see if you have the ability to step on it, I'm not afraid of you stepping on it...
