Fairy Trail Forest, also known as "Elf Village", is located in the east of Miracle Continent. is a bright village with a beautiful jungle. It is full of vitality everywhere. The emerald green grass, the petals fluttering from time to time and the small insects flying everywhere can be called a beautiful landscape painting. For those who hate the dull atmosphere of the Brave Continent, this is the best place to divert their emotions.

The monsters in the fairy forest are roughly divided into four parts. Going southeast from the south gate of the village is the habitat of the weakest goblins and hook-tailed scorpions; heading west is the habitat of ladybug monsters and long-distance poachers; heading northwest is the habitat of big goblins, dryads and sub Kun; from here to the east, you will meet the strongest monster in the fairy forest-the stone giant.

Fairy Trail Forest is the hometown of archers. The shops here are all tailor-made for archers, and you can buy primary equipment and consumables for archers. Compared to the Continent of the Brave and Icewind Dale, the population here is much smaller. Archers before level 20 are suitable for leveling here. After level 20, you can go to the Brave Continent to challenge skeleton monsters or go to Icewind Valley to challenge snowworms.
