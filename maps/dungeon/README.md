The dungeon is a rather deep cavern. Its entrance is in the northeast of the Brave Continent. This is the lair of Gordon, the right-hand man of the Demon King Quinton. It is deep, dark, and filled with the breath of death. Skeletons and scattered coffins all over the place. It gives the warriors who enter this place a gloomy and oppressive feeling.

There are 3 floors in the dungeon, and the structure of each floor is quite complicated. And there are deadly traps everywhere. It is a difficult leveling place, and the weakest monster needs to be above level 25 to deal with it. Contrary to the vastness of the field above, here are all linear corridors. The deeper you go into the cave, the higher the monster's level will be. Be especially wary of the necromancers that appear on the 2nd and 3rd floors of the basement, because it is a long-range palm thunder magic attack that is the most threatening to archers and magicians.
