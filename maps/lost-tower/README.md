It threatened Kundun to start a war, but the defeated Balrog was sealed underground
with the tower, leaving behind countless dragon corpses. Thousands of years pass,
and the Balrog awakens from its seal...

Balrog released from the seal along with mobs many times stronger than existing mobs,
such as Shadow, Poison Shadow, Death Cow, Devil, Death Knight, and Death Gorgon!

The Lost Tower (Resurrection of the Balrog) dealt with the resurrection of the Balrog,
who was buried underground due to Kundun's wrath in an attempt to usurp Kundun's place.

It consists of a total of 8 floors, and on each floor, high-level mobs that are stronger than Gorgons appear.

The Lost Tower is connected to Icewind Dale. This is a very dangerous place. Baroque was imprisoned here for defying the Demon Lord.

The level limit to enter here is 80! It can be seen how ferocious the monsters here are compared to the previous map! The Lost Tower has a total of 8 floors. Like the dungeon, the deeper you go inside, the higher the level of monsters and the more ferocious.

The battle going deep inside is ten times more dangerous than fighting Gordon on the third floor of the dungeon. So although you can enter at level 80, it is still recommended to come here to take risks after reaching 3 digits.

The boss here is the "Devil Baroque" with a gorgeous red metal coat. His fireball is the most powerful, and people with a level below 3 digits will basically be "killed" if they enter.
