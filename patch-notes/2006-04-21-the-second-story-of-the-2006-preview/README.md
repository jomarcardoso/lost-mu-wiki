- In addition to HP, MP, and AG, SD Gage (short for Shield Gage) is added to all characters.

- In case of damage during PvP, 90% of SD and 10% of HP are consumed.
- If damage greater than the current SD is received, the SD is consumed first and then the rest is consumed as HP.
- In case of poison damage, SD is consumed first and then HP is consumed.
- SD can be automatically recovered under certain conditions.

  - Recovery is also possible through the added SD recovery potion.
  - A new type of potion is added, which restores HP and SD at the same time.
  - Complex potions can be obtained by hunting monsters, and SD recovery potions can be obtained through normal combinations.
