# Add gem combination system, expand the benefits of the castle owner

Added a system to combine 10, 20, and 30 gems into one inventory slot when trading large amounts of items. In addition, the castle lord combination system, which allows you to combine special items through the Senate NPCs in the siege map, and the "Land of Trials", a hunting ground dedicated to the castle lord, will be greatly expanded by 2.5 times.

When trading, or storing a large amount of jewels in a warehouse or inventory, it was inconvenient to have to store them one by one.
In order to minimize the inconvenience of trading such a large amount of items or using the warehouse, a
system for combining 10, 20, and 30 jewels into one inventory slot has been added.
However, only "Jewels of Blessing" and "Jewels of Soul" can be combined.

## Gem Guild Merchant "Servis"

![](./img/shot23_a.jpg?mdFloat=right)

Servis was a black magician trainee, but rather than polishing magic, he had a deeper interest in alchemy, which uses mana to fuse and create various gems and minerals.
The ultimate goal he was trying to achieve through alchemy was the creation of a powerful magic stone that could contain a huge amount of mana, like the sealing stone created by the great wizard Etramu to seal Kundun. make new discoveries
In the process of creating the magic stone, while fusing various jewels containing powerful mana, he devised a way to condense the power of several jewels into one jewel, which made it inconvenient to carry dozens of jewels. It has helped alleviate the suffering of many people.
