# 1st changeup mastery system, combo & additional skill, hero system <small>18/11/2003</small>

"Blade Knight", "Muse Elf", and "Soul Master", who obtained new looks through the existing change-up system, have been further strengthened and have opportunities to acquire the qualifications of heroes.

## 1st changeup mastery system

Through the existing change-up system, ' Blade Knight ', ' Muse Elf ', and ' Soul Master ' , who obtained new looks, were further strengthened and had opportunities to acquire the qualifications of heroes.

The warriors currently on the Mu continent were already granted the ability as those who qualified for the empire, but it was not short of temporary power. Due to the actions of Etramu, the magician of Arca, who was concerned that he would not be able to properly use that power yet, he was wrapped up in a seal that suppressed his ability to be amplified, so he couldn't show his original ability. Now, the time has come for warriors with the ability to acquire the necessary qualifications. For the heroes who finally have the qualifications to digest power, I will teach them how to do it. Those who acquire the legendary treasure called 'Glory's Ring' and the 'Dark Stone' that creates new abilities will inherit the power of a true king and grow. It has been said that Glory's Ring has the power to revive life and give eternal youth. . If you find the Ring of Glory, you will be able to find the power that was imprisoned and grow. On the other hand, the Dark Stone is the hero 'Venelov' during the Demon War. It is a mystical jewel made from the hardened blood of Benelrope, and it is said that those who obtain it can be granted new abilities. However, the Dark Stone grants its power only to those who have the qualifications of a hero with great power. The hero, Benelope, inherited the blood of a knight, and after the defeat of the Demon God War, he gathered strength and mental strength to hone his skills and magic. Skills that were perfected to counter the forces of Kundun, which possessed even greater magical power after having their souls consumed by Sechneum, have been quietly handed down only to warriors who inherited knightly blood.
Those who qualify will be granted the ability of the hero Venelof by borrowing the Dark Stone.
