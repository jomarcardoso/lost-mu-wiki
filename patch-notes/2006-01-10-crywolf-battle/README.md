## Battle of Crywolf PROLOGUE

In order to break the stalemate on the frontlines, Kundun entrusts the invasion of Crywolf Fortress to the demonic corps led by Bargas. So, after receiving Kundun's order, Valgas struggled to find a way to attack the Cry Wolf Fortress. Through relentless and careful reconnaissance, Bargath finally discovered that the source of the fortress's protective power was a wolf statue in the center of the fortress, and that the statue's power weakened once a week for unknown reasons. Thus, Bargas begins to advance towards Crywolf Fortress, aiming for the time when the power of the god is weakening.
