**What is a Set Item?**

As an extension concept of existing items and excellent items, the more set items are collected, the
more new options that are different from the excellent options can be used, and
it is an item with a higher basic ability than an excellent item.

### Basic setting

- One type of set item can be combined with 3 to 9 types of weapons, defenses, rings, and necklaces.
- Some items do not have set items, in which case they do not consist of basic combinations and sets.
- There are no set items for special and quest items.

### Archangel's Items and Chaos Items

- You can equip a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 8 of the same type of set items, and
  additional options are applied depending on the number of set items.
- If all sets of the same type are equipped, it becomes a full set, and the full set option is applied to each set.
