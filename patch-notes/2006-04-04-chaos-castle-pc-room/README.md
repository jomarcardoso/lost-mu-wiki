It has been improved to make it easier to participate in Chaos Castle with the addition of a dedicated time slot for PC room users and a free patch for admission. Also, Chaos Castle's Zen raffle and reward system will be changed.

## Added Chaos Castle Time exclusively for PC rooms

Chaos Castle time slots for PC room users have been added, so if you log in from a PC room, you can participate in Chaos Castle exclusively for PC rooms, which is held at 19:30, 21:30, and 23:30.

> ※ PC room visitors can enter the existing Chaos Castle, but individual visitors cannot participate in the PC room-only Chaos Castle.

## Free admission to Chaos Castle for PC room users

1. Applicable only to users logged in from PC rooms.
2. Access to the PC room can enter both the newly added Chaos Castle and the existing Chaos Castle for free.
3. Among the conditions for entering Chaos Castle, the level limit and the purchase cost of the guard armor, except for the free admission, are applied as before.

> ※ The purchase cost of the guard's armor may be applied differently depending on the tax rate, and when accessing the PC room, you can enter without paying the admission fee.

## Deletion of gen lottery and strengthening of reward system

Regardless of PC room access or personal access, the winning part of the admission fee paid when entering has been deleted, and the number of gems obtainable within Chaos Castle has increased.
