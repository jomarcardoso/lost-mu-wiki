### Option setting

- Up to 3 options will be attached.

option(a)

- Randomly applies one of the three options that can be applied to wings (different for each wing).
- If options are not applied at the time of initial creation, options can be added using the Jewel of Life, just like existing wings.

| option name             | Black Knight 3rd | Warlock 3rd | Fairy 3rd | Magic Swordsman 3rd | Dark Lord 3rd |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| bonus attack power      | O                | X           | O         | O                   | O             |
| extra horsepower        | X                | O           | X         | O                   | X             |
| extra armor             | O                | O           | O         | X                   | O             |
| automatic life recovery | O                | O           | O         | O                   | O             |

Option (b)

- A random “lucky” option may appear.

option (c)

- Randomly, one of the four options may be attached, or none of the options may be attached.
- Option 1: [If the attack hits the target] 5% chance to ignore the enemy's defense
- Option 2: [If the target's attack hits the character] 5% chance to return the enemy's attack power
- Option 3: [If the target's attack hits the character] 5% chance of fully recovering the character's life
- Option 4: [If the target's attack hits the character] 5% chance of fully recovering character's mana

_The returned enemy attack power is a certain % of the pure enemy attack power without damage reduction calculations such as defense / wing absorption.
Returning enemy attack power overlaps with damage reflection of excellent items._

_Full life (mana) recovery is an instant recovery of 100% of life (mana), and it is applied after the opponent's attack hits and HP decreases._
