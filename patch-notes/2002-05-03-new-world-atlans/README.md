# New World Atlans <small>patch 0.64 (03/05/2002)</small>

Behind the beautiful [fairy](/character/fairy_elf) forest, [Noria](/map/noria), there was a gloomy deep sea called [Atlans](/map/atlans) like Janus Dark deep sea [Atlans](/map/atlans)!

[Atlans](/map/atlans) was a peaceful world that was out of reach of Kundun's forces. That peace is broken by the greed of Kundun's men.

Kundun had one of the eight sealing stones scattered across the continent of Mu and appointed the most vicious Hydra as the leader of the guard and no one made it inaccessible.

However, Hydra could not overcome the temptation of the sealing stone Etramu, which symbolizes Kundun's powerful power, and stole it away.

He obtained strong power and magic with the possession of the stolen Etramu, but fearing Kundun's retaliation led his men to hide in the peaceful [Atlans](/map/atlans) off the coast of Noria and claim himself as the king of the deep sea world.

In this chaos, some Atlansians fled to the surface world, and some Atlansians flee to the underground city [Kantur](/map/kanturu_ruins), which was destroyed by Hydra's invasion, and try to rebuild it.
