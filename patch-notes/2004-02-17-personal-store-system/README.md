# Personal store update

The personal shop system is a system that allows users to transact more comfortably with each other, and characters who have opened a shop can freely sell their items to other users during battle or while on the move.

> caution! 1. All items can only be traded with Zen. 2. General transactions (/trading) are not possible during shop opening and purchase.

## Open personal shop window

First of all, open the character's inventory window and press the 'Open personal shop' button next to the repair button or click the shortcut key S' to open the personal shop window.

You can also use the command `/personal shop` in the chat window.
