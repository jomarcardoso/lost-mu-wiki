# 4th Class: Magic Gladiator <small>Patch 0.47 (11/12/2001)</small>

The 4th character [Magic Gladiator](/character/magic_gladiator), which was exemplified at the beginning of the game, has appeared.

The [Magic Gladiator](/character/magic_gladiator) is automatically created in the character creation window when the existing character level is 220 or higher, and the character's appearance and abilities are superior to the [Dark Knight](/character/dark_knight), [Dark Wizard](/character/dark_wizard), and [Fairy Elf](/character/fairy_elf).

Basically, as well as running, it has almost the advantages of wizards and knights, so it will be more fun to raise.

If the level of the [Dark Knight](/character/dark_knight), [Dark Wizard](/character/dark_wizard), and [Fairy Elf](/character/fairy_elf) characters exceeds 220, you can create a hidden character [Magic Gladiator](/character/magic_gladiator) that did not exist in the character creation window.
