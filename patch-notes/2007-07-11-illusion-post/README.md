![](./img/upd_temple_data09.jpg "stone statue")

- Click on the statue and hold for 10 seconds to obtain the holy relic.
- If the user holding the relic clicks on the storage box and holds it for 10 seconds, points can be earned.

- Players who have acquired the Relic will have their movement speed reduced and their location displayed on the minimap.

![](./img/upd_temple_data11.jpg "Minimap Icon Description")

- If you store the relic in the storage box and score points, the relic will regenerate again.
- If the character carrying the relic dies, the relic will drop in its place.
- exclusive skill
  - It is a special skill that can be used at the temple and can be used when the Kill Point is satisfied.
  - All accumulated points are reset when a character dies, and 10 points are received again when the character dies and is regenerated. (accumulate up to 90 points)
  - Skill Selection: Mouse Wheel
  - Use Skill: Shift + right mouse click
  - Acquiring Kill Points

| --------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| ![](./img/upd_temple_skill01.gif) | spell of protection | Temporarily creates a shield that absorbs 100% of damage             | 5          | 15 seconds |
| ![](./img/upd_temple_skill02.gif) | spell of bondage    | Temporarily unable to move character                                 | 5          | 15 seconds |
| ![](./img/upd_temple_skill03.gif) | Order of Pursuit    | Move to the current location of the character who acquired the relic | 10         | -          |
| ![](./img/upd_temple_skill04.gif) | shieldburn          | Reduces target's current shield value by 50%                         | 5          | -          |

| Target  | points that can be earned |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| Monster | 2                         |
| Player  | 5                         |

- Since there are two respawn points for the Relic, it is recommended to distribute the number of people appropriately to explore.
- Once the relic is acquired, it can be moved to the location of the player it is carrying through the Pursuit spell.
- More strategic play is possible by using appropriate skills according to the situation.

### Success/Failure

success condition

- Among the teams that score 2 or more points in time, the high-scoring team wins.

| success     | detail                                                 | compensation   | Target                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | --------------------- |
| condition 1 | Earn 2 or more points within the set time & high score | Chaos Jewel x1 | all successful groups |
| condition 2 | If you get 7 points first                              | Chaos Jewel x1 | all successful groups |

failure condition

- Failure to obtain the same score
- Fail if the score is lower than the opponent's
- Fail if scoring less than 2 points

### Compensation

- Reward EXP Acquisition Formula

| Rating | A value base experience reward | B value acquisition points (per piece) |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 1      | 300000                         | 50000                                  |
| 2      | 340000                         | 60000                                  |
| 3      | 380000                         | 70000                                  |
| 4      | 420000                         | 80000                                  |
| 5      | 460000                         | 90000                                  |

- Reward EXP for Success
  - = (A+(Success Points - Failed Faction Points)*B)*2
- In case of failure (if there is a score)
  - reward EXP = A + points for the failed faction \* B
- In case of failure (if no points are earned)
  - reward experience = A

_Reward EXP is earned equally per group._

Official Ranking Points for Ranking Points

The more points you earn, the greater the reward experience you receive, so the point is to score a lot of points.

= Player Individual Reward EXP Value + (Player Kill Count _ C) + (Relic Carrying Count _ D) + E

| Rating | Player Kill Point (C value) | Number of relics carried (D value) |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |

| 5      | 3000                        | 6000                               |

| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E value   | 10  | 20  | 30  | 40  | 50  |
