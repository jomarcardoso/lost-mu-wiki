# Lord of the Rings <small>12/12/2003</small>

The Continent of Mu is at the center of a time of chaos. The followers of Kundun see only an opportunity to plunge us further into chaos. Our duty is not to wait for someone to guide us, but to learn and teach ourselves to rise. If you don't be afraid of the chaos in front of you and fight against it, you will get a ring that increases your ability and a price given to those who are courageous.

## One warrior's ring

Even after the death of Muren, the first king of the Mu Empire, Runedil, the queen of the fairies who watched the empire prosper, went through several wars and periods of confusion. Frequent wars only devastated the continent, and the number of warriors who lost her way began to increase. It was even harsher for her new warriors, so Runedil came up with a trick for them.

It originated from the custom that the first emperor, Myuren, handed out a ring with the emperor's crest as a token to boost the morale of the warriors. Her queen Runne Dill found the ring and bestowed it upon her fledgling warriors with elven powers.

They put on the ring and a period of peace gradually arrives due to the warriors regaining their valor.
The new warriors called it the 'Ring of the Warrior', and when they are equipped with the appearance of a seasoned warrior, they will exchange it for an item suitable for their abilities to provide an opportunity for greater growth.

As the time of peace came, the practice gradually disappeared, but in the time of chaos that reappeared, the 'Ring of the Warrior' will appear and for a while, the blessing of Runedil will be given to the new warriors.

## Attack of the White Mage

Lemuria, a follower of Kundun and leading the chaos on the continent of Mu, devises a strategy to raid the strategic points of the empire by scattering the warriors guarding each castle to various places.
Lemuria gave birth to a white wizard who granted his abilities through shamanic power through the jewel of blessing, and the wizard's ring, his alter ego. The magician's ring was immediately attached to the orcs and gave them the power of destruction, and the white wizard controlled them and raided all over the empire.

While the warriors of the empire are distracted by the attack of the Orc troops, the white wizard, another mental body of Lemuria, will take control of the center of the castle and cause another chaos. Before the castle is taken over by Lemuria's trick, you must steal the jewel of blessing that controls the white mage and the mage's ring from the orc of destruction to make them disappear.

Lemuria will not stop raiding the continent of Mu until its strength runs out, and the magician's ring that fell from the hand of the orc will remain for a while, multiplying the warrior's strength.

### event progress

First, at 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22 o'clock (total of 6 times), 1 White Wizard and 30 Orcs of Destruction will appear at random locations in Lorencia, Noria, and Debias, respectively.

Second, if you defeat the white wizard, 1 jewel of blessing will drop with a 100% chance, and if you defeat the orcs of destruction, the magician's ring will drop with a 50% chance.

### sorcerer's ring

When equipped, increases attack power by 10%, magic power by 10%, and attack speed by 10. Durability gradually decreases depending on the time it is equipped, and when it reaches 0, the special ability disappears.
