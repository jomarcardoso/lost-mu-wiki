# Low Level Support and Lost Kalima Compensation Patch <small>14/02/2006</small>

In order for beginner mutizens to experience a faster and stronger Mew, the system has been supplemented, such as lifting party level restrictions, increasing powerful experience points, increasing the use level of Shadow Phantom troop members, and selling Blood Castle's ticket combination materials, beads, and law books. Also, by supplementing the map characteristics of Lost Kalima, it has been improved so that more mutizens can explore Lost Kalima.

## Full party level restriction lifted

The party condition, which was limited to a maximum of 130 level difference between characters during a party, has been removed, so everyone can join a party regardless of the level difference. In the future, high-level and low-level characters can enjoy party play together without having to search for party members.
